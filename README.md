# PT4AL
The repository is the implementation of PT4AL in Python/PyTorch.

[PT4AL](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.07459.pdf) is SoTA Active Learning method according to paperswithcode so far(2022/09/21). 

Authors show their official implementation, but there are some suspicious parts. So I modify part of them and reimplement the same experiments as theirs.

The repository is forked from [here](https://github.com/johnsk95/PT4AL)
